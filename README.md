  ```bash
  bash vncstop.sh
  ```

## ‚öíÔ∏è Tools Installation

Install additional penetration testing tools using the `tools.sh` script.

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **VNC Connection Issues**: Ensure the VNC server is running and verify the connection port (default: `localhost:1`).
- **Sound Issues**: The `sound` function in `setup.sh` resolves common audio problems. Ensure PulseAudio is running.
- **Storage Issues**: If storage access fails, verify Termux has the required permissions:
  ```bash
  termux-setup-storage
  ```
