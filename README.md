# üöÄ Installation

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Midohajhouj/Kali-Nethunter.git
cd Kali-Nethunter
```

### Run the Setup Script
```bash
bash setup.sh
```
During installation, select one of the following options:
- **Full (15 GB)**: Complete version with all tools and features.
- **Minimal (2 GB)**: Lightweight version and we will customize it (Best option).
